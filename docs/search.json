I am Tyler an aspiring Data Scientist,\nThis Blog serves as part of my Senior Capstone Project at Brigham Young University of Idaho.\nMy Project entails developing and implementing an Algorithmic Trading Bot.

    "text": "Human Error\nWhen trading a stock or security the goal is to make profit from when you enter the position to where you exit. If you are in a long position you will most likely have some sort of exit indicator that lets you kno when you need to sell, if the stock is still increasing in price that could be difficult.\nThe opposite can be true as well, if your stock is dropping in price and you sell prematurely the stock may rise after causing greif and loss.\n\nFOMO\nFOMO stands for the Fear Of Missing Out. This often comes into play when an individual sees stocks breaking record highs and have been increasing nonstop for the last few time periods, they decide to buy thinking this will never stop. The stock could continue to increase or it could start dropping.\nWhen the stock starts to drop people will hold on longer than they should, hoping that the price will rise again until they final sell, just to see the stock continuing to rise a few days after they sell.\nWe as human beings get into patterns of hope and dispare, having a machine handle trading allows us to take an emotional backseat and trust in the process that we have created."

Due to the time and speed of the trade taking place. A few strategies that take advantage of this are:\n- **Arbitrage:** Exploiting price differences between an index and its futures or underlying components\n\n- **Order Book Imbalance:** Trading based on real-time buy and sell order imbalances\n\n- **Cross-Market Arbitrage:** Exploting price differences across mulitple markets\nMost of these strategies involve some sort of arbitrage, taking advantage of difference in prices in two or more markets."

    "text": "Large Analysis ( Minimal Analysis Paralysis)\nWhen creating an Algorithmic Trading Bot you have the oppurtunity to allow it to evaluate multiple indicators, and resources before deciding on a strategy or a trade. It gives us more computing power within a smaller amount of time.\n\nAnalysis Paralysis\nAnalysis Paralysis is a concept of analyzing too so much data as to the point where you feel paralyzed not knowing with direction to go or how to react, as there is always a great degree of unknown price movement, expecially within stock prices. Sometimes you need to take action even when unsure of the result, Algo Trading aids in this behavior, allowing you to pull the trigger and take action."

Relationship can be based off: - historical price patterns - correlation analysis - fundamental characteristics\nModel Dev: model developed to estimate the expected behavior of the pair of securities. Based off of: - statistical techniques - time sries analysis - machine learning models - quantitative methods\nDeviation Detection: model mnitors the prices or other relevant indicators, when a deviation from the expected relaionship is detected a trading signal is created. Deviation can be measured through: - z-scores - moving averages - other indicators\nTrade Execution: Involves buying one security and selling another security. Aiming to capture price discreptancies\nRisk Management: Need to employ risk controls: - stop-loss orders - position sizing rules - portfolio diversification\n\n\n\nWhen selecting pairs we want to identify assests with high correlation. A common example is Coca-Cola and PepsiCo as they have similar products and business models. There is a certain fundamental connection and a technical connection.\nIf the price relationship of the securities deviates from their long term average; “managers expecting the deviation to be temporary would go long on the underperforming stock (e.g., Coca-Cola) and simultaneously short the outperforming stock (e.g., PepsiCo).” (Analyst Prep)\nSo we are looking at the relationship between two stocks and when the value of one moves out of a certain range around their average, then you expect the value of one to drop and the other to rise, to move back to the mean.\nSo you short the top, and buy go long on the bottom, expecting them to meet in the middle.\nHow can we use ARIMA with this?? Can we use the ARIMA to predict the average of two different securities, to determine where the price deviations may meet up in the future?\n\n\nConintegration is a measure of the relationship between several time series in the longterm. - Introducted by Robert Engle and Clive Granfer in 1987\n“Cointegration tests identify scenarios where two or more non-stationary time series are integrated together in a way that they cannot deviate from equilibrium in the long term. The tests are used to identify the degree of sensitivity of two variables to the same average price over a specified period of time.”(CFI)\nBy defination the cointegration test determines whether the securities can’t deviate from each other in the long term. Which is great for our statisical arbitrage models, as we are just wanting to capture temporary discreptancies.\nTo perform this test we leave the time series data as non-stationary.\nCould we use a ML model to help determine whether this is a temporary discreptancy or a long term change?\n\n\n\n1.
