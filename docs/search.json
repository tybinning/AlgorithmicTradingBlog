    "text": "What is GARCH?\nG.A.R.C.H. stands for: Generalized AutoRegressive COnditional Heteroskedasticity. GARCH is used to help predict teh volatility of returns on financial assets. This model helps analyze time-series data where the variance error is believed to be serially autocorrelated.\nFirms use the resulting information to help determine pricing and judge which assets will potentially provide higher returns, as well as to forecast the returns of current investments to help in their asset allocation, hedging, risk management, and portfolio optimization decisions.\nFixes problems regarding to heteroskedasticity.\nThis means that it is a function of an average of its own past values.\n\n\nExtra Info\nBuilt upon ARCH: AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity. Assumes financial returns over time were not constant over time but autocorrelated, or conditional dependent on each other.\nThis demonstrated in stock returns where periods of volatility in returns tend to be clustered together.\n\nNGARCH: addresses correlation\nIGARCH: restricts the volatitlity parameter\nGARCH models are viewed to provide better gauges of risk than standard deviation alone\n\nARCH is a model used to analyze historical volatility in norder to predict future volatility. GARCH is an extenstion of ARCH model that allows for variance in the error term.\nHeteroskedasticity: when the error term changes over time."

One important detail is that members of congress have 48 hours to file these reports.\nThe basis of this study isn’t to gain value off of the price due to policy, but more so a larger focus on the surge of mindless bots that buy stocks off of the decision of a politician.\nThis analysis is also to detail whether there is a connection between volume and price increase as compared to the overall increase due to policy change, is there a disconnect? Or would it be better to join the herd?\n\n\nAutopilot"

    "text": "Human Error\nWhen trading a stock or security the goal is to make profit from when you enter the position to where you exit. If you are in a long position you will most likely have some sort of exit indicator that lets you kno when you need to sell, if the stock is still increasing in price that could be difficult.\nThe opposite can be true as well, if your stock is dropping in price and you sell prematurely the stock may rise after causing greif and loss.\n\nFOMO\nFOMO stands for the Fear Of Missing Out. This often comes into play when an individual sees stocks breaking record highs and have been increasing nonstop for the last few time periods, they decide to buy thinking this will never stop. The stock could continue to increase or it could start dropping.\nWhen the stock starts to drop people will hold on longer than they should, hoping that the price will rise again until they final sell, just to see the stock continuing to rise a few days after they sell.\nWe as human beings get into patterns of hope and dispare, having a machine handle trading allows us to take an emotional backseat and trust in the process that we have created."
