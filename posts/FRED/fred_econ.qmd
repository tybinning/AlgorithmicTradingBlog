## FRED? 

The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has numerious webservices that allow you to observe different economic data and research. 

**FRED** Stands for: **F**ederal **R**eserve**E**conomic**D**ata.

## FRED API
For my current Algorithmic trading project the FRED API will be significantly useful.

For my project I am using `fredapi` which is a python wrapper around the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis's API. This allows for simpler documentation on my end.



The code above demonstrates a sample of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) data collected from our API pull.
