# Overall Learning and Experience  

## Introduction  
Working with **Schwab’s API** for algorithmic trading provided hands-on experience in developing an automated trading system. From fetching real-time market data to executing trades and optimizing strategy performance, this project involved a combination of technical skills, problem-solving, and real-world application of financial concepts.  

Throughout this journey, I encountered challenges related to **API authentication, time series data processing, and trade execution**, which helped refine my coding skills and improve my understanding of financial market behavior. This experience also strengthened my ability to think critically, troubleshoot errors, and make data-driven decisions.  

## Skills Learned  

### **1. API Integration & Data Handling**  
- Successfully **authenticated and connected** to Schwab’s API using OAuth 2.0.  
- Implemented **data requests** to fetch historical and real-time stock market data.  
- Optimized API calls to handle **rate limits and response errors efficiently**.  

### **2. Working with Time Series Data**  
- Collected and **preprocessed historical price data** for backtesting.  
- Used **moving averages,Keltner Channels and Bollinger Bands** for feature engineering.  
- Applied **time series smoothing techniques** to reduce noise and improve trend detection.  
- Resampled data for different time intervals (e.g., converting minute-level data to hourly or daily).  
- Used **autocorrelation and stationarity tests** to determine market trends and seasonality.  

### **3. Algorithmic Trading Development**  
- Designed and implemented **momentum and mean-reversion trading strategies**.  
- Built a **backtesting framework** to evaluate strategy performance before live deployment.  
- Integrated **real-time order execution**, allowing automated buy/sell decisions based on market signals.  

### **4. Cloud Deployment & Automation**  
- Deployed the trading bot on **AWS EC2** to run continuously.  
- Automated trade execution and data collection with **CronJobs and AWS Lambda**.  
- Stored market data in a **structured database** for further analysis.  

### **5. Error Handling & Risk Management**  
- Implemented **fail-safes for trade execution** to avoid unintended orders.  
- Developed logging mechanisms to track **API response errors and execution failures**.  
- Applied **risk management rules**, such as stop-loss limits and position sizing, to minimize losses.  

## Soft Skills Gained  

### **1. Problem-Solving & Debugging**  
- Faced and resolved authentication errors related to OAuth 2.0 token expiration.  
- Debugged **incomplete or missing data** in time series datasets.  
- Optimized **data retrieval and preprocessing** to handle large datasets efficiently.  

### **2. Adaptability & Learning Mindset**  
- Learned **Schwab’s API documentation** from scratch and applied it effectively.  
- Adapted strategies based on real-time market conditions and backtesting results.  
- Explored **alternative APIs** and data sources to enhance decision-making.  

### **3. Time Management & Project Organization**  
- Balanced multiple components, including **data collection, strategy development, and deployment**.  
- Created a structured workflow to ensure progress in **both coding and financial analysis**.  
- Managed time effectively to refine and iterate trading strategies based on new insights.  

## Conclusion  
Working with **Schwab’s API** has been a valuable learning experience, combining **time series analysis, real-time data processing, and automated trading**. By integrating **historical data, algorithmic strategies, and cloud automation**, I have gained a strong foundation in **financial technology and quantitative trading**.  

Moving forward, I plan to enhance this system with **machine learning for trade filtering, improved risk management techniques, and additional data sources** to further refine strategy performance. This project has not only deepened my technical skills but also reinforced the importance of continuous learning and adaptability in algorithmic trading.
