Algorithmic Trading is automated trading at it's core.

# What is Algorithmic Trading?

Algorithmic Trading is essentually the proccess of automating a trading strategy. 
This has a few perks:

    - Takes out human error
    - Allows for time intensive strategies
    - Larger Analysis

## Human Error

When trading a stock or security the goal is to make profit from when you enter the position to where you exit. If you are in a long position you will most likely have some sort of exit indicator that lets you kno when you need to sell, if the stock is still increasing in price that could be difficult.

The opposite can be true as well, if your stock is dropping in price and you sell prematurely the stock may rise after causing greif and loss.

### FOMO

FOMO stands for the **Fear Of Missing Out**. This often comes into play when an individual sees stocks breaking record highs and have been increasing nonstop for the last few time periods, they decide to buy thinking this will never stop. The stock could continue to increase or it could start dropping. 

When the stock starts to drop people will hold on longer than they should, hoping that the price will rise again until they final sell, just to see the stock continuing to rise a few days after they sell. 

We as human beings get into patterns of hope and dispare, having a machine handle trading allows us to take an emotional backseat and trust in the process that we have created.

## Allows for High Frequency Trading

With the use of Algorithmic Trading and Automated trading we can use strategies that wouldn't be feasible without it. Due to the time and speed of the trade taking place. A few strategies that take advantage of this are:

    - **Arbitrage:** Exploiting price differences between an index and its futures or underlying components

    - **Order Book Imbalance:** Trading based on real-time buy and sell order imbalances

    - **Cross-Market Arbitrage:** Exploting price differences across mulitple markets

Most of these strategies involve some sort of arbitrage, taking advantage of difference in prices in two or more markets.

## Large Analysis ( Minimal Analysis Paralysis)

When creating an Algorithmic Trading Bot you have the oppurtunity to allow it to evaluate multiple indicators, and resources before deciding on a strategy or a trade. It gives us more computing power within a smaller amount of time.

### Analysis Paralysis

Analysis Paralysis is a concept of analyzing too so much data as to the point where you feel paralyzed not knowing with direction to go or how to react, as there is always a great degree of unknown price movement, expecially within stock prices. Sometimes you need to take action even when unsure of the result, Algo Trading aids in this behavior, allowing you to pull the trigger and take action.

## Conclusion

There are many benefits of algorithmic trading, I prefer the concept of autonomy, and the prevention or analysis paraylysis. The biggest flaw an algorithmic trading bot has, is the flaws that we bake into it. This can amplify our investments in a positive or a negative direction. It is up to us how we build them.
